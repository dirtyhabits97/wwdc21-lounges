# WWDC21 Lounges

Unedited questions and answers from the WWDC21 SwiftUI and Developer Tools Slack lounges.

The text files contain short of 500 unfiltered questions, some of them have great answers, others request to file a feedback and others remain unanswered. There's also discussions from community members on some of them.

If you saved a question/answer that is not saved here feel free to send a PR and it will be merged.
