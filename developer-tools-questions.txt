@Ruslan has asked:
Hi, thank you for organizing this! I have a question about CI, in regards to Xcode Cloud. I remember having troubles (no "std output" was printed anywhere) running certain scripts in Pre-build and post-build actions in Scheme editor when I was using Xcode Server & Bots back in 2015. The question is shall we rely on pre-build action for, say, running things like `pod install` and other pre-build setup w/o which the project cannot be run?

Xcode Cloud supports custom CI-specific build scripts that are distinct from pre-build action scripts in your Xcode scheme. The logging from these scripts is captured and made available in your workflow results. See some documentation about this here:

I have a question around testing - I was trying to figure out a way to test scenarios around IAP family sharing, either in the simulator using App Store Config files, or even in Sandbox on device.  I can't seem to find a way to simulate something like having a purchase made available via a family purchase made by someone else, or to simulate having a purchase revoked via the head of family disabling family sharing (or someone leaving a family).  Would testing in sandbox on two devices that were set up with family sharing be able to test these scenarios?  Was also wondering about generating server to server notifications for those events as well, but even just being able to test in Xcode would be helpful.

Thanks, I've develop my code to handle the scenarios outlined in that document, I'm more wondering how I can trigger those in simulator testing...  for example, if I'm running in the Xcode simulator, is there any StoreKit testing feature that would trigger the  paymentQueue(_:didRevokeEntitlementsForProductIdentifiers:) method of SKPaymentTransactionObserver?  I'd like to be able to test my code to make sure my handling of that method works correctly.

Thanks for the followup.  For the server to server notification, unfortunately not.  Please file a feedback ticket for us to add that functionality (and add a followup here with the FB# if you have time to do so now).   For the first case, yes!  After a purchase is made, open the StoreKit Transaction Manager (Debug > StoreKit > Manage Transactions), you can select a transaction and refund it.  This will cause paymentQueue(_:didRevokeEntitlementsForProductIdentifiers:) to be called within your app.

For context on one typical use case: apps that have not only a frontend component but also have backend server components require integration testing when the backend systems change.

You can configure Xcode Cloud to do this the same way you would set it up for an at-desk workflow: with a custom Run Script step in your build.

One concrete approach is to turn on Apple Generic Versioning in your project and then add a hook script that calls agvtool to increment the version (see 'xcrun man agvtool’ for more info on the tool).

Ask a questionWORKFLOW  4 days ago
Follow-up question from @Rashid:
A run script in the build would increment build/version number adding one (+1) to the current number in the source code which would be the build/version number on the git repo.
Is there any approach that can increment version number and push it to the repo without re-triggering the build?
:white_check_mark:
1

Sean (Apple)  4 days ago
You can configure an Xcode Cloud job to trigger on a push to a branch, so if you didn't want to trigger a build but wanted to increment the version number, then you could use something like a git hook to increment the number with agvtool  (or do it manually) and push to a different branch than the one which your workflow is triggered off of.

Sean (Apple)  4 days ago
Additionally, you can configure Xcode Cloud to ignore changes to specific files. However, the build number is stored in your project file, which isn't something you'd want to ignore if it's changed. Check out this documentation for more info on how to do this for other use cases.

Myke (Apple)  4 days ago
@Sean (Apple) wanted to add a minor additional detail: Xcode Cloud will auto increment build numbers, but won't auto increment version numbers. Build numbers don't have to be globally unique - only unique to a version number. Version numbers must be globally unique. Version numbers are what get used when submitting an app to iTunes Connect.

Hello!:slightly_smiling_face: For general, self maintained CI/CD xcodebuild is your best friend. The "Testing in Xcode" session from WWDC19 hits on some best practices that may be useful to you: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/413/
Some points I'd like to highlight from the session:
The testing pyramid, to help strike the right balance between unit, integration, and UI tests
Using test plans efficiently for the variables you want to change between test runs
What configuration works best for your needs when planning CI/CD set up. At times it is useful to have a separate builder machine from test runner, in which case you'll break your executions into build-for-testing and test-without-building, but it really depends on your use case

You can add secret environment variables to a workflow. They are "write-only", meaning that once set, secret environment variables cannot be read again from the workflow editor.
Secret environment variables are encrypted in transit and at rest, and used only on the ephemeral build environment. As such they are suitable for AWS keys, passwords, and API tokens.

Hi there! I see that Xcode Cloud supports custom scripts for bootstrapping the temporary environment, but is/will there be a mechanism for caching some of the dependencies? For example a Ruby version installed via rbenv, and bundler dependencies. These are things we typically would never check into Git but could do with caching somewhere like we can on other platforms

Caching build dependencies is not currently supported, but you might be able to do that yourself in a custom build script. You may want to give it a try to see if you could get it to work.  That’s great feedback though so please file a report on feedbackassistant.apple.com

xcodebuild has a long-standing difference (FB5531332)  from Xcode's testing behaviour: it ignores the LocationScenarioReference (Location Simulation in the Xcode Scheme Run Options) in a scheme.
This limits the kind of integration testing we can do on CI and requires workarounds to mock Core Location which is crucial to our app's functionality.

Xcode Cloud workflow configuration is not stored in the Xcode project file; the configuration is persisted only in the cloud services that support the service.
Being centralized in the cloud, the configuration can be accessed through the Xcode UI itself, the App Store Connect web UI, and also programmatically through the App Store Connect public REST API (available this summer). The API uses JSON format.

Yes, you can continue to use a deployment target older than macOS 12.0! The requirements are:
You must build and submit from Xcode 13 and use a provisioning profile
The TestFlight client supports macOS 12 and later, so builds aren't installable on older macOS versions.

Hi John! We include homebrew by default on the VMs in Xcode Cloud. You can read more about how dependencies can be made available to a workflow here.
That said, if you're concerned about a supply-side attack, or dependencies in your application being bad actors, you can conceivably audit the environment in a post-clone script after Xcode Cloud clones your source code into its environment. I haven't tried removing homebrew from the VM, but theoretically you could remove it or prevent it from phoning home. (edited)

@Joe (Apple) replied:
Streaming data still makes a lot of sense in the realm of async/await. In Swift 5.5 we now have the `AsyncSequence` protocol, which is similar to a simplified Combine `Publisher`, and you can use similar functional APIs to manipulate async sequences as you would Combine streams, or adapt Combine streams to AsyncSequence as well. In async/await code, you can use `for await` loops to process async sequences. AsyncSequence and Combine are still great for modeling streams of async events, and you can use async/await in functions to process streams at the boundary when that stream model no longer makes sense.

For Swift APIs, you'll need to do the adaptation to `async` on your own. The "Meet async/await in Swift" session gives some examples of how to use `CheckedContinuation` to adapt existing callback-based APIs to async functions. You can do this gradually, though, since the callback and async code can coexist, so you don't have to rewrite the world all at once to get the benefits of async.

Sorry you have to deal with that. When the compiler analyzes a switch statement for exhaustiveness, it has some heuristics for very large enums that are intended to keep compiler performance good even in the face of complex patterns with very large sets of enum cases, but it can lead to false-negative cases when that goes wrong. If you have a moment to try to extract some of your code into a test case, and submit an issue to bugs.swift.org, we might be able to use it to further refine these heuristics.

Yeah, you can launch either of the forms of unstructured task from sync code. In Xcode beta 1, there is `async { }`, which will start a new async task that runs on the same actor as the launching context (which can be important if that's the MainActor, for main-thread-bound UI work), and `asyncDetached { }`, which will start a completely independent task. If you've been following Swift open source, though, you may know that these names have been revised due to feedback from the open source community; they're known as `Task` and `Task.detached` currently.

The primary use case we’ve focused on is for other developers to import your package into their project as a dependency. That lets them use Build Documentation to build the docs locally and view the docs in Xcode’s Documentation window.
For other workflows, you can make a .doccarchive downloadable from your website.  For example, you could zip the archive and have it as a downloadable resource on your site.
If you have a different workflow in mind, post a followup and we can look at that specifically, or if you have other feedback we’d love to get your specific use case in a Feedback Assistant.

@Brandon would like to ask:
It looks like the DocC single page web app requires server side rewrite rules.
Do you have any tips for using CDNs which don't support this? Github Pages has a longstanding issue (https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/408) and, given that many Swift packages are hosted on Github, it seems like many projects will want to host their docs there.

Thanks for the feedback. We understand that this is an important workflow. You are correct that the server side rule is required for now. One potential workaround for this would be to copy the `index.html` file from the documentation archive for each symbol page using a filesystem directory/filename structure that matches the given path for each page. This would be a way of satisfying the constraints of needing static files for the CDN scenario.

@Dachary has asked:
The "Host and Automate DocC Documentation" presentation mentions: "The main page groups important symbols into topics related to higher-level tasks. Each of those group related symbols into more specific topics."
Can you talk more about how those groupings happen? Is that something we dictate by the way we organize and present content in the framework, or can we manually specify groupings?

@Jack (Apple) replied:
Organizing your pages into groups is a great way to improve your documentation! To do that, you create a Topics section with a second-level heading called "Topics", followed by a group title in a third-level heading, and then a bulleted list of links.
We describe the syntax in more detail here https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-structure-to-your-documentation-pages, under "Arrange Top-Level Symbols Using Topic Groups". We also have a session tomorrow that shows how to do this: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10167/ along with some other ways you can improve your documentation.

Usually a problem of documentation is that it becomes obsolete with time. Is there any way to prevent this by using docC? Is there any validation in the code that can be autocompleted?

Ask a questionWORKFLOW  4 days ago
@Jack (Apple) replied:
We think so too! It's important to keep documentation up to date with the changes you make in your code. Like a code compiler, DocC can emit warnings and errors when it finds something that doesn't quite look right.
For example, DocC checks all of the links in your documentation you've written using double-backtick syntax, like ``MyType``. If you remove or change the name of an API in your code, Xcode will display a warning on the line containing the documentation letting you know that you should update your docs.

DocC integrates with the Swift compiler to extract information about the public symbols and their documentation during the build.
The author of an xcframework can build and export that framework’s documentation and distribute it alongside the xcframework to enable consumers to read the framework's documentation in Xcode.

Hey David! thanks for the answer. Do you have any tips or references on how to best distribute them together with the xcframework so that they are detected by Xcode? Is there any SPM tooling around this or is your answer more about a context of a manual import? Thank you very much!

Ask a questionWORKFLOW  4 days ago
@David (Apple) replied:
That's a great question and something that we want to explore more.
For now, this can be accomplished if the framework author exports and uploads a separate zip file of the DocC Archive. Consumers of the xcframework can then download the documentation archive, and double-click it to import that documentation into Xcode.

Hi Jeff, good question!  When you use the Build Documentation menu in Xcode, the doccarchive does go into the derived data directory, so if you clear that, you would have to rebuild the docs.
If you want to keep a version of the built docs in the Documentation window, you can export the doccarchive, and then you can double click it which imports it back into the Documentation window.  When you import a .doccarchive, Xcode puts it into an “Imported Documentation” section of the Documentation window, and that doesn't get removed when cleaning the derived data.

Yes, DocC works with both local and remote Swift packages.
If you open the Swift package in Xcode, and use the Product > Build Documentation menu item, Xcode will build documentation for both that package and its dependencies (both local and remote).
Note: if you use a documentation catalog in your Swift package, make sure that the Package manifest’s swift-tools-version is set to 5.5

For App Store screenshots, I would like to use the simulator tool to take a picture with the device bezels embedded with the image. But when I do this with 12.5, I only get an screenshot with a 'cutout' of the device shape. How should I enable it to capture both the screen and the device bezel together?

Hello there!
Currently we do not support this. The screenshot tool in Simulator can create images which are suitable for a variety of media. If you are trying to capture screenshots of your app for marketing materials, I suggest that you speak to the fine people over at the App Store for advice on how to take screenshots of your app for the store.

Hi Andrew! You should still be able to view your Info.plist file by opening it in the project navigator on the left-hand side of the Xcode window. If you want to view the Info.plist file as it appears after building your app, select your .app bundle, Control-click or right-click it, and select Show Package Contents. The Info.plist file should be in there. If this is a traditional macOS app, it may be under the Contents folder.

Is there a recommended way to control simulator setup when running UI tests? For example, for ui testing I need to disable the hardware keyboard but for regular development, it’s not practical to do that.
It’s a bit disruptive having to enable/disable it each time so I’m wondering if i can control this kind of thing somehow?

Thanks for the great question! We have a helpful command line tool for Simulators that you can run via `xcrun simctl` that can do a lot of useful automation and setup. Here's a video from a previous WWDC session for more information: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/418 . If you find functionality missing from simctl, please do submit feedback through Feedback Assistant!! Also, one thing that you might try if you're doing this often... You can run all of your setup steps on a Simulator device, shut it down, then make a clone of that device with `xcrun simctl clone`, and then use that cloned device for testing. This might also be a good question to discuss with one of our Simulator engineers in our labs, so if that sounds like it would be helpful to you, please visit https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/labs , search for Simulator in the "Search WWDC21 labs..." field, and request an appointment.

When we changed our CI to GitHub Actions we started having issues with some simulators while running tests. Apparently sometimes (it seemed at random) when launching the simulator this would try to do some kind of "synchronisation", and it would stay idle for a few minutes, this, before running tests.
Is there a way to avoid this 'synchronisation' to happen?
PS: apologies in advance if you think this is related to the CI provider and not the simulator itself.

I believe issues like this occur in CI systems where "fresh" hosts are instantiated for each job.
I've observed performance issues due to `update_dyld_sim_shared_cache` running after booting a simulator for the first time — which on CI tends to coincide when attempting to run a test suite.

Ask a questionWORKFLOW  3 days ago
@Jason (Apple) replied:
Thanks for the follow-up! I think it might still be helpful to request a lab appointment with one of our Simulator engineers to talk through the issues here. It’s difficult to recommend a good solution without having a better understanding of all the issues. :) If the bottleneck you’re seeing is resource constraints because the dyld shared cache is being built at the same time as your tests are running, you could try adding to your CI scripting to build the dyld shared cache first, allow that to complete, and then run your UI tests after. You can do this by running `xcrun simctl runtime update_dyld_shared_cache`. Please note that this command is not currently documented externally and is subject to change. If this command is helpful to you, please file a Feedback Report and ask for this functionality to be made more broadly available. If it would be helpful to have a flag for `xcrun simctl boot` which changed the behavior to wait until the shared cache is generated before booting the device, please file a Feedback Report for that as well. Again, it’s hard to make a good recommendation without a full understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve, and the best way to do that would be to request a lab appointment as mentioned above. Hope this helps!!

All recent versions (definitely iOS 5+ but possibly back to iOS 4) of the iOS simulator runtime have provided a version of CoreAnimation built from the same sources as the corresponding version for devices.

Currently we create alpha builds for QA on a regularly basis using an Enterprise certificate. We distribute the alpha builds using Bitrise. On every alpha release we notify QA via a slack channel and they get a short description of the release, a download url as text and QR code (to ease installation from device). Would I be able to have the same flow using Xcode Cloud? And would I be able to distribute enterprise builds via TestFlight?

Hi! You can definitely achieve this workflow with Xcode Cloud - in fact we expect it would be significantly easier.
You can set up a workflow that deploys to an internal TestFlight group representing your QA team (and also notifies in slack). They can then install the build through the TestFlight app.
You don't need to worry about Enterprise signing to do this

Yes. Bear in mind that creating your first workflow with Xcode Cloud happens from Xcode. It analyzes your project locally, suggests a configuration to quickly create you first workflow.
In the scenario where you do not check in your Xcode project file, then these are the adjusted setup steps:
1. You need to generate the Xcode project file locally.
2. To exclude it from your repo, you could add a `.gitignore` rule.
3. Add the add Xcode project generation to post-clone script.

Given that the legacy build system is deprecated, we're still noticing that the new build system is slower to run a build than the old one. We're very sensitive to build performance -- currently a roughly no-op build with the legacy build system is roughly 60s on a recent Mac Pro with our codebase and considerably less than that on legacy.

The basic settings are in the build settings in the project file; for example, the bundle identifier is now a `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` setting.
If you would like to extract them into a dedicated Info.plist file and use that instead, though, you can add an Info.plist file to your project, go to the Info tab for a target in the Project Editor, copy the synthesized Info.plist content from there, and paste it into your Info.plist file. Then set the Info.plist File build setting to the path of the new source Info.plist file, and turn off the “Generate Info.plist File” setting in the build settings.

3 replies

Ask a questionWORKFLOW  1 day ago
@Michael (Apple) replied:
SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS defines the platforms a target supports building for. For example a framework target which can be built for either iOS or watchOS.
ALLOW_TARGET_PLATFORM_SPECIALIZATION allows a target to build for multiple platforms in a single build. For example, building an iOS app with an included watchOS app, both of which depend on that framework, so the framework can be built for both platforms.
But XCFrameworks still need to be built with a separate xcodebuild invocation.

@Caleb has asked:
My team produces a number of software components, and we've recently switched from packaging them as static frameworks to XCFrameworks. Xcode doesn't have a target type for producing XCFrameworks (please tell me that I'm wrong!), so that packaging happens in a post-archive script. When we were just producing static frameworks, we could drop several of our projects into a common workspace and it was easy to debug right into each of those frameworks -- Xcode figures out that since the Foo project builds the Foo framework, other projects in the workspace should link against that. We'd really like to do the same thing with our XCFrameworks, but they don't seem to be supported as well.

SDK is mix of Objc and Swift.

Does Xcode Cloud needs to always run a test/archive/build action? We have a particular workflow in our CI, we first upload de app with bitcode to TestFlight and then some hours later we try to grab the processed dSYMs and upload them to a 3rd party crash tool, if we migrate to Xcode Cloud this particular workflow doesn't need to test or archive the project, it only searches for dSYM and upload it somewhere else.

You have the flexibility to just `build`, or just `archive`, or just `analyze` if you like. In this case, you would need to just `archive`.

Hello there! I have a question about the new Swift-based localization emitter in Xcode 13 (SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS). The implication is that the compiler is running on the *.swift on the project -- is there a way to invoke the swift compiler to emit these strings directly instead of using the the Xcode UI and/or `xcodebuild -exportLocalizations`?

Although this does not work today, we’re interested to know what functionality from “xcrun simctl” you would like to use from within your UI tests, since some capabilities may be accessible via supported APIs. If you could please file a Feedback describing the commands from that tool you would find useful during tests that would be great.

Hi Austin
Xcode Cloud can greatly add value, even for individual developers. It can easily help you validate the code you write by starting integration jobs that will also run your tests on multiple run destinations (i.e. iOS/iPadOS simulator, Mac Catalyst) in addition to building. This way, you will feel more confident about your work when shipping updates of your App (it also handles code-signing for you).
With Xcode Cloud, your project is ready to accept outside contributions without needing to maintain a CI infrastructure.

Thanks Ted! I love sharing how we got started with Diversity in Swift.
As I was learning Swift a few years ago, I quickly fell in love with the language - I was so impressed with how easy it was to learn, and its extensibility. I wanted to share my love with it for people, and it got me thinking about how there aren’t as many communities and support groups the later you get in your career. I am immensely grateful to the support I received through community groups in college and as a new grad, and wanted to replicate that same feeling of empowerment through learning. I reached out to some folks working on Swift at Apple, and that’s how I met Ted and Holly! Soon after that we looped in Kristina, and the external members of Diversity in Swift, Paul Hudson and Kaya Thomas.
We’re really excited about the community groups and initiatives we’ve launched so far, and so excited to keep building things for this community.

Not so much a resource as a tip: try not to make assumptions about people who ask for help.

Try to remember what it was like when you didn’t know that thing, and also try to remember that the tech industry is full of confusing terminology and overloaded terms.

Not too familiar with language design, but the fact that Swift tries to draw from the better aspects of the many languages across the industry makes it appealing to people from other programming environments.

Christian  1 day ago
I think it's really fascinating to see the candid discussions folks have on how a feature or change should potentially materialize. It makes it less opaque and even if you might not agree with the result it's really cool to at least see how it got there. I'll sometimes go into it like “that's a little peculiar!” and leave being like “ohhh, okay yeah that’s pretty cool”

Programming languages are/should be creative tools for as many people as possible. If the community that creates those languages is diverse, the resulting tool will be approachable to more people, leading to more approachable apps and more quality of life for those who use them.

I think it’s always going to be important to talk about the things we’re doing well, and also the things we’re doing less well.
A few years ago I went to a PyCon event here in the UK, and they worked hard to make sure everyone felt welcome – speech-to-text transcription for all talks, induction loops for hearing aid users, sign language interpreters available on request, preferred seating for folks who need it, free childcare with qualified childminders, a quiet room for breastfeeding parents, and more. Heck, the day I attended was Children’s Day because they had a whole series of sessions lined up aimed at helping kids code with Python.
That’s pretty much the gold standard I want us to be striving towards in our events, and if we’re going to get there then we as a community need to talk about it and work towards it.

Forums are scary for me usually, but since pride in swift opened and I joined that for some reason I suddenly felt like I belonged to the community, even though I’m not active there (yet). That and the interactions I have here at WWDC are so motivating and encouraging and I think that feeling is an integral part of learning.

@Christian has asked:
Jetsams keep me up at night. I love how the Xcode Organizer has made important data very easy to get to, but I sometimes still find it opaque when my app is jetsam’d or how often it occurs when I have users emailing me about the app having a refresh state when they come back to it. I think it would be awesome if Xcode could break down how you’re doing with jetsam events versus the previous version, plus for bonus points what class of device it’s mostly occurring for and what you’re being evicted for (eg CPU versus memory usage). I think this would help me sleep better.

@Christian has asked:
One common crasher I’ve had over the last year in TestFlight crash logs is users saying something along the lines of “came back to the app after leaving for a minute and it asked if I wanted to report the crash”. I’ve been slightly confused because they don’t come with an accompanying .crash file, just the JSON device details. This led me to think it’s probably jetsam, but is it normal for jetsam to report it as a crash to the user that way? Do you know if there’s maybe a crash report file with some jetsam details in iOS 15?

This is...interesting. The expectation is that all TestFlight crashes are accompanied with a crash log. If you see this on your device, you can always check Settings > Privacy > Analytics Data and see if a crash log was created for your app. If there isn't a Feedback would be in order. Jetsams shouldn't be producing a request a TestFlight feedback prompt

This a tough question, but once you start to recognize why your app is crashing you can start to notice patterns in your code. You might be making assumptions about optionality that aren't true or that some data exists when it doesn't actually, or there are data races in your code. There are plenty of great sessions about how to get started with XCTest and the new Swift concurrency features can help eliminate whole classes of crashes by removing the possibility of data races!

BCSymbolMap are a map of obfuscated symbol names to actual symbol names. They are generated for any bitcode binaries. When bitcode is compiled, a dSYM of obfuscated symbols names is generated.
When you use the "Download Debug Symbols" button in the Xcode Archives Organizer, the Downloaded dSYMs are de-obfuscated using the local BCSymbolMap files in the archive selected. If you uploaded BCSymbolMap files when uploading your app (by selecting "Upload Symbols" in the distribution assistant in Xcode), then the dSYMs generated by the App Store are de-obfuscated.

When I am looking at a new crash in an area I am not familiar with, one of the first things I do is try to understand _why_ it is crashing. Asking yourself questions can also help you get a quick understanding of what kind of crash it is. "Is it crashing because I made an assumption I shouldn't be?" "Is this framework I am using expecting something different than what I am giving it?" "Does this only happen sometimes?"
Answering those questions can get you started on understand the crash and then working towards a fix!

Yes, that is correct — there would be two separate targets, one with Swift sources and the other with Objective-C sources, and they can be combined into the same library product.  It is also possible (and fairly common) to have the Swift target depend on the Clang target, if this is being used to provide Swift wrappers on C-based APIs.  In this case, only the Swift target would need to be added to the product, and its dependency on the Clang target would indirectly include it in the product too.

@Tom (Apple) replied:
Starting Swift 5.4, Swift Package Manager caches package dependencies on a per-user basis, which reduces the amount of network traffic and increases performance of dependency resolution for subsequent uses of the same package. This means that while the initial clone may still be slow depending on the repository size, subsequent clones are much faster. This can also be used in CI by configuring the cache location. See https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-4-released/

@Alex has asked:
Interested in setting up a swift package collection for my company’s internal packages (these are all private GitHub repos.)
The collection itself works great in xcode, but I’d like to be able to host the collection json itself on a private GitHub repo. Is this something that’s supported, or does supplying something like a GitHub personal token or being signed into source control from Xcode’s preferences allow for non-public internet sources to be used? (Or at least a url located in hosted source control with the same access token permissions as the repositories which are being accessed within the collection itself)

@Ruchish has asked:
if we have 2 projects, where both released as SDKs (Dynamic Frameworks), and where one consumes another, how would they recommend to package them?
In last one year we have faced many challenges due to Objective-C and Swift mixture of our project and our consumer asks for XCFramework but we end up confusing on how one Dynamic Framework planned to release as XCFramework can link another XCFramework. Would that be simple linking with Do not Embed and Host app needs to link both.
Want some expert input on possible approach that will smooth delivery process.

A possible approach to take would be building dynamic XCFrameworks from the "leaf" level up. Start with the library that has no dependencies and build it as an XCFramework. Next use that XCFrameworks as a dependency for another library and build another XCFramework (while not embedding it as you already said). Then once you assembled all your XCFrameworks, tell your users to include all of them as part of their project.

We have a SwiftPM package which depends on a library that is not easily built with SwiftPM. So we use it as a “system library” dependency on Linux.

It should be possible to accomplish this with conditional target dependencies, by having two targets in the package:  a system target and a binary target.  Your main target would then have a conditional dependency on the system target, specifying a Linux platform condition, and also a conditional dependency on the binary target, specifying a macOS/iOS dependency.

Can Static Analyzer in Xcode 13 find dead code like unused variables and methods?

@Artem (Apple) replied:
Xcode provides compiler warnings for unused local variables and unused static functions and unused C++ private methods. There are no warnings for unused Objective-C methods because in Objective-C it's a fairly hard technical problem as it's a very dynamic language. The static analyzer provides additional warnings for problems that require deeper analysis such as unused initializations or assignments that get immediately overwritten ("dead stores") and redundant if-clauses and operands in expressions (new in this release! - off by default, see the "Unused Code" section in build settings).

The best way to prevent false positives, when the analyzer reports about the path that couldn't happen in reality, is to assert the invariant. So, if the analyzer assumes something that you know is false, you can add `NSAssert`.

It can indeed be tricky sometimes, but we can advise broadening new assertions to cover those extra cases that the analyzer finds. And when it's not possible, using `#ifndef __clang_analyzer__` is the  best way to go.

@Artem (Apple) replied:
The infinite loop warning tries to avoid flagging intentionally infinite loops, such as the program's (or a thread's) event loop. One thing it looks for is "condition variables": if the loop loops until the condition hits, the developer has clearly intended the loop to be terminated by hitting the condition at some point. This way we can diagnose if it is impossible to hit the condition.
Additionally, in the general case, the static analyzer generally prefers to err on the side of not displaying the warning when it's not sure. It is not guaranteed to flag all bugs. We're continuously working on covering more cases but there will always be cases where it's still unsure.
Finally, judging by the lack of semicolon, I suspect that your code might be Swift code. The static analyzer can detect bugs in C/C++ and ObjC code; it doesn’t detect bugs in Swift code, however, you can use the analyzer on mixed Swift-ObjC projects.

@Artem (Apple) replied:
This is a great question! The static analyzer will analyze all third party code as long as it's getting compiled when you're building your app (i.e., binary frameworks aren't analyzed) and it's written in a language supported by the static analyzer (i.e. C/C++/Objective-C but not Swift). There is no way to exclude individual frameworks but given that the source code is available, you may have a chance to edit it to suppress unwanted warnings.

@Artem (Apple) replied:
The static analyzer generally works well on a mixture of Objective-C and C++ code. It can find null pointer dereferences and it also supports nullability annotations for finding misplaced nil pointers, like in Ravi's presentation.
Calling an Objective-C method on a nil Objective-C pointer doesn't typically result in a crash though. There may be a different reason for the crash.
Generally speaking, the static analyzer's ability to find such bugs depends largely on how "local" they are. If the static analyzer sees a problematic execution path in its entirety it'll warn you about it but there's a certain limit to how spread out are the assignment and the crash.
Static analysis shines at discovering exotic cornercases that can be discovered by looking at a relatively small portion of your code - which is often still much larger than what a human can audit. But it's not necessarily the right tool for debugging individual crashes that you have already reproduced; you might want to use runtime debugging tools for that, such as the debugger, logging, or run-time assertions that will help you to find out if your program's internal invariants are violated.
