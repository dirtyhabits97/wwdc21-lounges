If the symbols are OS-version dependent, why aren’t the names provided via an enum?

I think that’s because they’re not exactly a closed set, or something you’d want to switch over :slightly_smiling_face:

Symbol drawing is highly optimized. Palette’s should NOT be an issue. (edited)

Would there be a protocol to populate custom colors so that they also get the built-in features for free (dark/light/blur adapting)?

@Jeff No, Widgets use a separate API.

Nice to be able to set privacy sensitivity

Andrew  4 days ago
Yeah I too wonder if Canvas is Metal (GPU) accelerated or if it still done on the CPU like CoreGraphics drawing is.

For some reason when I install the beta, the old app is broken. But new one works great. (edited) 

Taylor (Apple)  4 days ago
@Jeff, for most use cases yes, and has increased flexibility in that it takes both Color and shape styles. The rich graphics session has some really cool examples of that

I think SF Symbols would make more sense on the Mac App Store under the developer tools category, but not a big deal.

Love the drawing with Canvas. Also love the spatial audio used in the videos. AAA+++

Alejandro  4 days ago
The video implies that you can share with other apps what you have drawn with Canvas. Is that correct? Is there an API to export SwiftUI views to images that can be shared or saved on disk? without going to uikit/appkit ofc :stuck_out_tongue:

Taylor (Apple)  4 days ago
@Alejandro, what do you mean by share with other apps?  There is not yet a SwiftUI API for snapshotting a view as an image
:ok_hand:

Alejandro  4 days ago
@Taylor (Apple) oh thanks. I meant that the video talked about share providers and switched to Canvas. I thought they were related ^^ sorry my mistake.
it would be nice if that api existed tho :stuck_out_tongue:
I’m using SwiftUI outside apps, from terminal CLI tools, and is very handy to generate graphics :heart: Canvas just makes it even better!! but is a bit of a pain to have to use appkit for saving the images.

Taylor (Apple)  4 days ago
No worries! If you haven’t already, do file a feedback to request that enhancement, it’s always useful to know how many people would like a new feature :slightly_smiling_face:
