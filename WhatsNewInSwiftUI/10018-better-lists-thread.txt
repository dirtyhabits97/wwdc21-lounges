I’ll be able to replace home-grown Async Image with AsyncImage!  I wonder if we can specific cache for AsyncImage, or if it’s standard/automatic?

Does AsyncImage work with Quick Look generated thumbnails?

Philip  4 days ago
Literally yesterday I was futzing with the separator in Lists, trying to use LazyVStacks instead to get rid of them, then realizing that it won’t work to let me do “onDelete” on my list items because it’s not a list anymore. So happy to see this simplified.

How does AsyncImage behave in a long list? Should we worry about reused rows and/or load times (do all of them load at once or as we scroll?)

Matthew  4 days ago
Wow, async interation — that is phenomenal (.task modifier)

Can .swipeActions work on ScrollView/VStack views? Or only on a List?

Sam (Apple)  4 days ago
I wouldn’t say that task is equivalent to view did load. Think of it as some async piece of work whose lifetime is tied to the view it’s attached to. The task will live as long as the view does, and will be automatically canceled when the view’s lifetime ends.

async/await is awesome in other languages, but cancellation is often missed. Appreciate the attention to detail!

Are timers a good candidate to run there? Or there will be performance issues?

Joseph  4 days ago
I avoided list because I struggle with drag and drop so had to reimplement the swipe to delete. Also made my own grid with offsets for another project (though that project also had to target 13)..

Rajée  4 days ago
@Sam (Apple) Ok thanks! I'll have to play with it - does it re-trigger if the view is reloaded/remade as in from a publisher or something?

Tom  4 days ago
I'll be disappointed if the door code isn't 1337

does .task happen once or can it be triggered many times

:exploding_head: passing bindings to List and ForEach is GENIUS. Should make multi-select operations much easier.

@Jacob (Apple) Does this mean that the images themselves are cached as part of the shared url cache? I know UIImage in UIKIt land there's a system cache.

@Taylor (Apple) for the new  Table would it be possible to have a pinned column and header (spreadsheet style)

Geraldine  4 days ago
Question about lists. I’m using it to display async images list similar to the Unsplash app. The images leading and trailing sides don’t have padding and there is 1 point of spacing between each row. Is this possible to achieve with the new lists?

Taylor (Apple)  4 days ago
@Romy, the singular column headers are always pinned to the top. But if you wanted to have multiple pinned headers or columns, Table wouldn’t be a good fit for that use case.

Geraldine  4 days ago
Never mind. I figured it out. Use the .listRowInsets view modifier to configure the padding for list items.
