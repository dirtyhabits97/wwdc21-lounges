Native AddToSiriButton similar to SignInWithAppleButton()?

Seyed Parsa  4 days ago
But easy for an app to abuse the property, turning all the buttons to prominent to draw user focus. :disappointed:

This Feedback Assistant button should be larger! I'll file one about it using the button.

Are buttons without indicators considered good UX? Do you suggest using them?

Do destructive buttons on watchOS (assuming the platform is covered) come with some sort of "are you sure" sheet?

Curt (Apple):couch_and_lamp:  4 days ago
I’d suggest using disabling indicators with care. They are less discoverable.

It’s a good design question! Definitely consider your users and if they’d expect a menu to be shown or not from the button. (edited)

They’re good accelerators for things like forward/back buttons that advanced users will appreciate.

Where would I learn about ways to have existing SwiftUI code inherit the newer features so I could support both iOS 14 and 15

It’s worth noting that lots of these new APIs (like menu with a primaryAction) utilize Multiple Trailing Closures. But it’s not just newly added APIs that got this treatment: Many existing APIs have been given overloads that utilize Multiple Trailing Closures so you can use a consistent style throughout your apps :slightly_smiling_face: (edited)
