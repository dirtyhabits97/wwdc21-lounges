How's the performance of the table with large datasets? (I have issues with performance of List on macOS already with not too many rows in a List)

As a fun note: Some of the Foundation API behind Table, namely the SortComparator protocol is quite general and can be used to drive your tables with all kinds of data sources: SortDescriptor for CoreData driven tables, KeyPathComparator for in-memory data, and for other data sources, you can provide custom implementations of SortComparator!

And that’s available on every platform, and can be used alongside List or your own views! (edited)

@Taylor (Apple) How can we customize search text box by using searchable? Should we return to old style adding text box?

@Seyed Parsa Look into the SearchFieldPlacement type. It provides a few different locations for the search field that you can pass to the searchable modifier (.searchable(text: $text, placement: .sidebar))
